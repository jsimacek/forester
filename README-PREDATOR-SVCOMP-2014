Instructions for SV-COMP'14
===========================

(1) Build Predator from sources.  On Ubuntu 12.04, please follow the
    instructions in docs/README-ubuntu.


(2) Use the 'sl_build/check-property.sh' script to verify each single test-case.

Usage: check-property.sh --propertyfile FILE [--trace FILE] -- path/to/test-case.c [-m32|-m64] [CFLAGS]

    -p, --propertyfile FILE
          A file specifying the verification property.  See the competition
          rules for details: http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2014/rules.php

    -t, --trace FILE
          A file name to write the trace to.

    The verification result (TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN) will be printed to
    standard output.  All other information will be printed to standard error
    output (or the file specified by the --trace option).  There is no timeout
    or ulimit set by this script.  If these constraints are violated, it should
    be treated as UNKNOWN result.  Do not forget to use the -m32 option when
    compiling 32bit preprocessed code on a 64bit OS.

    For memory safety category, the FALSE result is further clarified as
    FALSE(p) where p is the property for which the Predator judges the
    program to be unsatisfactory.
