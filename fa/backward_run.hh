	 *                        state in @p fwdTrace was empty), for the case when
	 *                        the forward trace is spurious.
	 * @param[out] predicate  A forest automaton which was extracted as a good
	 *                        predicate to be used in predicate abstraction, for
	 *                        the case when the forward trace is spurious
