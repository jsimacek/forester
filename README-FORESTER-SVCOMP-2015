Instructions for SV-COMP'15
===========================

1) Build Forester from sources against GCC system. We recommend to use gcc-4.6.
   Please follow the instructions in the README file.

2) For running SV-COMP test-case please use script 'fa_build/sv_comp_run.py'.
   Note that the script requires python 2.7.

Usage: sv_comp_run.py usage: sv_comp_run.py [-h] --trace TRACE [--properties PROPERTIES] file
       -h         Print help 
       --trace TRACE
	      A file to print witness to
	   --properties PROPERTIES
	      A file with specified verification properties
	   file
	      A path to a file with test case

	   Since Forester participates only in Memory Safety and Heap Manipulation categories
	   the 32 bit architecture is used as default and cannot be changed by any parameter.

A result of a verification task is from {TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN}
and it is printed to standard output. A witness trace related to
the verification task is printed to a specified trace file when the
result is FALSE. When there are more verification properties to be
checked and one of them is violated, the answer has format FALSE(p)
where p is violated property.
